		<h1><u>The Gang Banger's Group page</u></h1>
		<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<p>We are the Gangbangers group, which consist 5 important people...<ul><em><b> <li>Shayan</li> <li>Zayan</li> <li>Rayan</li> <li>Daniyal</li> <li>Ehab</li> <li>ariz</li> <li>Vihaan</li></b></em> </ul>
	Let me tell you the legendary legend of this group.<br>This dates back to 2020, four years ago at One evening, a cute handsome boy wanted to bicycle outside with his father.<br> They had an amazing time and decided to go somewhere knew, like somewhere where they have not been before. and stubled accross quetta street.<br> this, is where the gang banger group originated... this is where the legend Shayan met Zayan and his little brother, Daniyal.<br> Where my father was a friend of his father from college. and we spent friends for a good 1 and halve years.<br> until one pacific evening when me and zayan decided to cycle and circle outside our home, we kept seeing this one guy, everytime we saw him, we get an auro of greatness, greatness in sigmas.<br> So Zayan decided to talk to him and ask of him. <br>"Hello, Do you wana cycle with us?"<br> And thus from here onward, we had added another member of our gangbanger group.. Rayan.<br> Now so far the gang was going perfect, but before i tell you who came next in 	our gang banger member, first let me tell you this story.<br> long before the Shayan And zayan met and created the gang.<br> Shayan used to hang out with Ammar, we used to cycle alot and we used to play sports alot, but one day we just stoped, we stop cycling, we stop playing sport, we stoped meeting each other.<br> but after the rayan was officially part of the gangbanger group...<br> We saw Ammars brother playing outside, so we decided to say hi and leave, and it was like this for a long time.<br> But then we were playing soccer one day with random people and they had to go and it was too early to home, and it was at this time where the great legendary zayan had to move a few blocks away from the origin,<br> so we had to think of some way to keep our time busy. and we saw Ammars brother, The great legendary Ehab and Ariz.<br> were playing goalkeepers. so we decided to play with them, and this from here onward, we had added 2 more people to our member... Ehab and Ariz.<br> We cant forget The next legend, Vi	haan, Extremely telented and quick to learn, became part of our group after a few months when Ammars brother was added to the group.<br> He was here before Ehab and Ariz but he wasn't added to the group offically until a few months after.<br> The Gang bangers Have sticked together for 4 years but one unfaithful day...<br> the day we did not loos, but we got seperated, Zayan had to move again, but it wasn't a few blocks away, it wasn't a 5 minute drive. it was 30 minute drive away from our origin. But even that wont keep the gangbangers away from each other.<br> </p>
